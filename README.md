**Project 3: Interactive Gird Box Display**
# Dynamic Box

Welcome to the Dynamic Box project! This project is a React application that demonstrates the concept of dynamic rendering and interactive user experiences through a grid of dynamically generated boxes.

## Features

- **Dynamic Box Generation**: The application dynamically generates a grid of boxes based on user input, allowing for flexible customization.
- **Interactive Boxes**: Users can interact with each box by clicking on them, triggering dynamic changes in their appearance or behavior.
- **State Management**: The project showcases state management in React, highlighting the use of hooks such as `useState` for handling dynamic data.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You need to have Node.js and npm installed on your computer. If you don't have them installed, you can download and install them from [Node.js's official website](https://nodejs.org/).

This will run the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser. The page will reload if you make edits.

## How to Use

1. **Input Grid Size**: Enter the desired number of rows and columns for the grid in the input fields provided.
2. **Generate Grid**: Click on the "Generate Grid" button to dynamically create the grid based on your input.
3. **Interact with Boxes**: Click on any box within the grid to experience interactive behavior, such as changing colors, animations, or other dynamic effects.

## Built With

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - The JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) - Used for custom styling and animations
